# float boat

This is a 3D CAD model of a powered twin-pontoon boat, designed in Fusion 360. Itâ€™s intended for operation on calm water or icy surfaces, using a BLDC motor and a rudder for propulsion and steering.

## Overview

The boat features:

- Two large **pontoons** for buoyancy and stability.
- A **central platform** to mount electronics or payload.
- A **rear-mounted BLDC motor** with propeller for propulsion.
- An **underwater rudder**, controlled by a servo motor, for steering.

## Components

- **Pontoons**: 3D-printable or foam-compatible. Provide floatation and lateral balance.
- **Platform Deck**: Flat area for battery, ESC, receiver, etc.
- **Motor Mount**: Positioned at the rear for direct propulsion.
- **Rudder Assembly**: Suspended beneath the deck, controlled by servo via linkage.
- **Support Arches**: Structural frames connecting pontoons to the main deck.
- **Vertical Fin** (optional): Could be used for wind stability or sensor mounting.

## Control System

- **BLDC Motor** with propeller, powered by LiPo and ESC.
- **Rudder Servo** for steering.
- **RC Receiver** or onboard controller (Arduino, Pixhawk, etc).

## Suggested Materials

- Pontoons: Lightweight foam, PETG, or ABS (if 3D printed).
- Structure: PLA or carbon fiber rods for support bars.
- Deck: Plywood, plastic sheet, or 3D printed plate.
- Electronics: Standard RC components or DIY flight controller.

## Applications

- Educational robotics project
- Water drone or small autonomous surface vehicle
- Test platform for RC or Arduino control

## To-Do

- Add internal compartment or waterproof box for electronics.
- Design propeller guard for safety.
- Integrate GPS or IMU for autonomous navigation (optional).
